- ## 👋 Hi, I’m @Retrodawg26
👀 I’m interested in hardware-oriented engineering — embedded systems, digital logic, computer architecture, microcontrollers, and VLSI fundamentals.
🌱 I’m currently building strong foundations in C programming, digital electronics, and hardware design concepts, with Python on the side.
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on beginner-to-intermediate projects related to embedded systems, low-level programming, and hardware-oriented software.
📫 How to reach me:

😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
⚡ Fun fact: I have facts that aren’t funny, and funny ideas that definitely aren’t facts — engineering happens somewhere in between.
